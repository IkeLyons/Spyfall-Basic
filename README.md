# spyfall-basic

This is what will hopefully become a very basic spyfall app using node.js with socket.io, express.js and maybe other libraries. 

There are multiple other spyfall repos out there. I don't have huge ambitions with this project, it is mainly to teach me some basic web development while also making a basic fun game :)
